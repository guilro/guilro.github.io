![Profile picture](/images/profile.jpg)

I am a French self-taught developer, mostly interested at the moment in web development. I started with HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP when I was 13, thanks to the french website [siteduzero.com] (it did not get better in quality), and some horrible Javascript tutorials.

I learned to use Symfony in 2012, and decided to give a try to [node.js] in October 2013 because of [socket.io]. I fell in love and rediscovered Javascript again. I am also interested in [ReactPHP], as I still love the language and want to better understand the core concepts of event loops, thanks to the project being in early stage.

Between the first years of secondary school and my master degree, I also became a user of GNU/Linux, learned a bit of C, with GLib and GTK+, and even gave a try to [Vala] during a few months - which I like a lot but is almost useless outside from the Gnome platform. I also used Drupal and its API for smaller projects.

I never earned money from my hobby (my real occupation is to study economics), but I contributed to several projects, and helped non-profit organizations.

I got in 2015 a master degree in economics, from [ENS Cachan] and [Panthéon-Sorbonne University] in France. I worked on international economics, game theory and experimental economics. I spent year 2013-2014 at [Humboldt University] in Berlin, where among other things, I had the opportunity to work on fields mixing economics and computer science. This year (2015-2016), I follow the [EPOG] program in Paris, where I study innovation and collaborative work in the open source field.

Oh, and Free Software means something to me.
